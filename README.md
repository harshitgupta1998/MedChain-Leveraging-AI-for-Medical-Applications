# MedChain: Leveraging AI for Medical Applications

## Overview
**MedChain** is a comprehensive platform demonstrating the integration of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary libraries to build intelligent workflows for healthcare. This includes analyzing medical text, extracting critical insights from images (e.g., prescriptions, reports) using OCR, facilitating financial analysis relevant to healthcare providers, and now incorporating **AI Agents** for expanded automation and intelligent task management.

## Features
- **Medical Text Analysis**  
  Processes and generates insights from medical literature and documentation using OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Cohere APIs.  
  - Summaries of complex medical documents  
  - Extraction of keywords, conditions, and medications  
  - Specialized query-answering

- **AI-Assisted Financial Insights**  
  Provides basic workflows to analyze financial statements and insurance claims.  
  - Identifies cost-saving opportunities and highlights anomalous entries  
  - Assists in processing large volumes of financial data

- **AI Agents**  
  Automates and orchestrates complex tasks across the MedChain ecosystem.  
  - Coordinates multiple pipelines (OCR, LLM processing, financial analysis)  
  - Streamlines repetitive tasks such as data extraction, scheduling, or triaging  
  - Facilitates end-to-end workflows from document ingestion to insights generation
