# MedChain: Leveraging AI for Medical Applications

## Overview
**MedChain** is a comprehensive platform demonstrating the integration of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary libraries to build intelligent workflows for healthcare. This includes analyzing medical text, extracting critical insights from images (e.g., prescriptions, reports) using OCR, facilitating financial analysis relevant to healthcare providers, and now incorporating **AI Agents** for expanded automation and intelligent task management.

## Features
- **Medical Text Analysis**  
  Processes and generates insights from medical literature and documentation using OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Cohere APIs.  
  - Summaries of complex medical documents  
  - Extraction of keywords, conditions, and medications  
  - Specialized query-answering

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**  
  Extracts text from medical imaging (e.g., prescriptions, lab reports) using Tesseract OCR.  
  - Transforms scanned or handwritten notes into machine-readable text  
  - Helps reduce manual entry and transcription errors

- **AI-Assisted Financial Insights**  
  Provides basic workflows to analyze financial statements and insurance claims.  
  - Identifies cost-saving opportunities and highlights anomalous entries  
  - Assists in processing large volumes of financial data

- **AI Agents**  
  Automates and orchestrates complex tasks across the MedChain ecosystem.  
  - Coordinates multiple pipelines (OCR, LLM processing, financial analysis)  
  - Streamlines repetitive tasks such as data extraction, scheduling, or triaging  
  - Facilitates end-to-end workflows from document ingestion to insights generation

## Use Cases
- **Medical Insights Generation**  
  Analyze and summarize lengthy medical documents or research papers using LLMs.  
  - Accelerates decision-making with concise overviews  
  - Automates extraction of clinical or treatment information

- **OCR in Healthcare**  
  Digitize handwritten prescriptions or lab reports for further processing.  
  - Enables quick search and retrieval of patient data  
  - Reduces manual data entry and potential for human error

- **Financial Analysis for Healthcare**  
  Parse insurance data and identify billing anomalies or trends.  
  - Simplifies revenue cycle management  
  - Helps administrators make data-driven financial decisions

- **Advanced Automation with AI Agents**  
  Orchestrate multiple MedChain modules to power intelligent automation.  
  - Use agents to detect relevant steps and trigger workflows automatically  
  - Provide continuous monitoring and decision support
