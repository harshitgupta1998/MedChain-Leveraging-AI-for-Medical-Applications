# MedChain: Leveraging AI for Medical Applications

## Overview
**MedChain** demonstrates the integration of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary libraries to build intelligent workflows tailored for medical applications. This project incorporates tools for analyzing medical text, extracting critical insights from images using OCR, and financial analysis relevant to healthcare providers.

## Features
- **Medical Text Analysis**: Processes and generates insights from medical literature and documentation using OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Cohere APIs.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extracts text from medical imaging (e.g., prescriptions, reports) using Tesseract OCR.
  
## Use Cases
- **Medical Insights Generation**: Analyze and summarize lengthy medical documents or reports using LLMs.
- **OCR in Healthcare**: Digitize handwritten prescriptions or lab reports for further processing.
